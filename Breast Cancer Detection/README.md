# Breast cancer detection

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Breast Cancer Detection  
**Dataset**: `Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set`
**Level**: Beginner

This project is designed to demonstrate machine learning skills and techniques typically used by data scientist to explore, clean, and analyze breast cancer. The project involves collecting data from Kaggle dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predicting type of cancer (benign or malignant) using machine learning algorithms. This project is ideal for those who are starting their journey in data science and want to build a solid foundation in machine learning.

## Objectives

1. Predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant
